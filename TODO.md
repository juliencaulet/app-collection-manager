## Notes
- Follow modular development approach
- Implement features incrementally
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Document all major changes
- Follow naming conventions strictly
- Adhere to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) methodology:
  - Centralize common functionality
  - Reuse code through inheritance and composition
  - Maintain single source of truth for configurations
  - Use shared utilities for common operations
  - Keep business logic in dedicated services
